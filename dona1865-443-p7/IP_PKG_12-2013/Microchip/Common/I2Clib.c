** 24LC254 EEPROM I2C Library
** Richard Wall
** October 13, 2011
**
** Notes:  	This file has been adapteded from the Microchip C32
**			Peripheral Library documentation.  Unlike the example file 
**			that appears in Chapter 14 of the C32 Peripheral Library 
**			Reference Manual, the programs contained in I2clib.c and 
**			I2Clib.h are written for multiple byte transfers. 
**
**			The BRG_VALUE used in the initI2C function is equal to the 
**			PB clock rate divided by the desired bit rate. The transfer 
**			rate that is set in I2Clib.h is limited to 400,000 bits per 
**			second. Truncation and rounding have no ill effects provided
**			the rounding process results in a bit rate less than 400000.
**
**			The I2CWrtiteEEPROM function has three distinctive write 
**			phases.  
**			Phase 1: Write the I2C device address and starting memory
**					 address. No STOP sequence is issued after header
**					 bytes are written to the I2C device.  The I2C 
**					 device must acknowledge each transfer.  If the 
**					 acknowledge is not receive by the master, this and
**					 all subsequent phases for the EEPROM write are
**					 aborted. The program returns the i2c_error status:
**					 FALSE indicates no error.
**			Phase 2: Write the I2C data.  This is limited to a maximum 
**					 of 64 bytes and all must be to address with in one 
**					 page boundary.  (Page boundaries are memory addresses
**					 modulo 64.) I2C device must acknowledge each transfer.  
**					 If the acknowledge is not receive by the master, this 
**					 and all subsequent phases for the EEPROM write are
**					 aborted. This sequence is terminated with a STOP 
**					 sequence. The program returns the i2c_error status:
**					 FALSE indicates no error.
**			Phase 3: Repeatedly write a single byte containing the device 
**					 address and checking the acknowledge status bit until 
**					 cleared (active low signal). It is handled by the
**					 wait_i2c_xfer function and returns the number of write-
**					 byte cycles before detecting an acknowledgment from
**					 the slave device. 
**			Note 1:	 The count value is consistently 64. This is most likely 
**					 related to the fact that entire page (64 bytes) is 
**					 written regardless of bytes in the transfer. Hence, writing 
**					 to an EEPROM is a very long process. 
**			Note 2:  This version of code does not observe the page writing 
**					 restrictions mentioned in Phase 2. 
**
**			The I2CReadEEPROM function is capable of reading all 32768
**			bytes of data with a single call to this function. This 
**			function is comprised of three phases.
**			Phase 1: Write the I2C device address and starting memory
**					 address. Unlike the I2CWrtiteEEPROM function a STOP 
**					 sequence is NOT issued after header bytes are written to 
**					 the I2C device. The I2C device must acknowledge each 
					 write of the header array.  If the acknowledge 
**					 is not receive by the master, this and all subsequent 
**					 phases for the EEPROM read are aborted. The program 
**					 returns the i2c_error status: FALSE indicates no error.
**			Phase 2: After each N-1 bytes are read into the receiving buffer,
**					 an ACK (acknowledgement) bit is sent to the slave device 
**					 by the master.
**			Phase 3: After the Nth byte read from the I2C device and 
**					 stored into the receiving buffer, an NAK ( not 
**					 acknowledge) bit is sent to the slave device by the master.
